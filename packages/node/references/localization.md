# Localization & Language Detection — Operator Guide

ChatGPT renders most of its interactive controls with **localized text** (button
`aria-label`s, menu items, placeholders, and login/rate-limit copy). The browser-control
runtime matches several of those by their visible/accessible name, so a non-English
ChatGPT session can cause selectors to miss. This guide explains how the SDK isolates
that risk, how to add a new language, and how to keep it working as ChatGPT's UI changes.

This is an **operator/maintainer** document. You do not need to read any TypeScript to add
a language — you edit one data file.

## TL;DR

1. Every locale-sensitive string lives under
   [`src/dom/locale/`](../src/dom/locale/):
   - `en.ts` — the complete English (canonical) values.
   - `<bcp47>.ts` — one file per additional language (partial — only keys that differ).
   - `index.ts` — the combiner; register new locale files here.
   - `types.ts` — the `LocaleStrings` / `LocaleContribution` type definitions.
   - [`src/dom/locale-labels.ts`](../src/dom/locale-labels.ts) is a thin barrel that
     re-exports `localeLabels`, `anyLabelPattern`, and `escapeRegExp` — **consumer import
     paths do not change**.
2. Each entry is an **ordered candidate list**. English is canonical and stays first.
   Stage 2 verifies the registry shape with `doctor({ check: ["localization"] })`;
   selector consumers are still being wired to consume every localized candidate.
3. **Never add a string you have not observed in a real localized session.** The
   `selector_drift` blocker is the safety net *and* the discovery tool — it reports the
   localized labels it actually saw.
4. After editing, rebuild + test + bundle + sync (see [Verification](#verification)).

## Design

```
ChatGPT DOM (localized) ─▶ matcher being localized ─▶ locale/index.ts candidates
                                                │
                                       no candidate matches
                                                ▼
                                       selector_drift blocker
                                       (returns the labels it DID see)
```

The registry is designed for three match styles. Some runtime consumers still hard-code
English labels; until those consumers are rewired, the localization doctor check is a
registry-readiness diagnostic rather than proof that a localized session will pass every
workflow selector.

| Style | Where | How a candidate is matched |
|---|---|---|
| Accessible-name RegExp | Playwright `getByRole`/`getByPlaceholder` | `anyLabelPattern()` builds a case-insensitive substring alternation |
| CSS attribute clause | download controls | one `aria-label*=`/`=` clause generated per candidate |
| Browser-context / Node text | streaming + blocker heuristics | candidates passed in and matched with whole-word or substring regex |

Two rules that never change regardless of language:

- **API keys stay English.** Callers pass `effort: "Thinking"`, `tool: "web_search"`. Only
  the *matched DOM text* is localized. You add the German label to the registry array; the
  caller-facing key is untouched.
- **Structural anchors are language-agnostic and are not in this file.** Element ids
  (`#composer-plus-btn`, `#upload-files`), `data-message-author-role`,
  `data-testid^='conversation-turn'`, `a[href^='/c/']`, `a[download]`, and
  `href*='/backend-api/files/'` work in every locale and stay in the selectors directly.

## What is localized (and what is deliberately not)

Localized — lives in `src/dom/locale/en.ts` (English) and per-locale files, safe to extend:

| Registry key | Surface | Capture from |
|---|---|---|
| `composerTextbox` | composer textbox | `aria-label` |
| `sendButton` | send button | `aria-label` |
| `searchChatsButton` | search-chats button | `aria-label` |
| `searchChatsPlaceholder` | search input | `placeholder` (mind the ellipsis — see caveats) |
| `newChat` | new-chat button | `aria-label` |
| `addFilesButton` / `addFilesOpenerCandidates` | add-files opener | `aria-label` |
| `addPhotosFilesMenuItem` | "Add photos & files" menu item | visible menu text |
| `projectSourcesTab` / `projectSourcesAddSource` / `projectSourcesUploadFiles` | Project Sources tab and append-add flow | visible tab/button/menu text |
| `copyResponse` | copy-response button | `aria-label` |
| `download` / `downloadImage` / `imageContainerHint` | download affordances | `aria-label` / container hint |
| `modeLabels` / `modeOpenerExtra` | model/effort switcher | visible button + menu text |
| `tools.web_search` / `tools.deep_research` / `tools.create_image` | tool menu items | visible menu text |
| `signedInMarkers` | signed-in detection | sidebar/shell words |
| `transientAssistant` | streaming placeholder filter | assistant streaming text ("Thinking", etc.) |
| `stopControl` | "still generating" detection | stop-button text |
| `responseActions` | response-complete fallback | action-bar text |
| `loginBlocker` / `captchaBlocker` / `rateLimitBlocker` | blocker classification | wall/challenge/limit copy |

**Do NOT localize these** — they are not ChatGPT-localized UI text:

- Structural anchors listed above (ids, `data-*`, hrefs).
- Blocker patterns that are HTTP/numeric codes (`404`), our own bridge-error fragments
  (`fileChooser.setFiles`, `permission denied`, `upload failed`), or the modal heuristic —
  these stay literal in [`src/safety/blockers.ts`](../src/safety/blockers.ts).
- The image-status regex variants in `isTransientAssistantText`
  (`analyzing/processing/reading images`) are still English-inline; only the exact-match
  `transientAssistant` phrases are registry-driven. Localize these only if a real session
  shows a localized equivalent.

The type definitions for `LocaleStrings` (complete) and `LocaleContribution` (partial, for
non-English files) live in [`src/dom/locale/types.ts`](../src/dom/locale/types.ts).

## Adding a new language

### Step 1 — put a real ChatGPT session into the target language

Set the account language (ChatGPT **Settings → General → Language**) or the locale ChatGPT
honors for your environment, and reload. Confirm the visible UI actually changed — some
surfaces remain English even when the account language is switched.

### Step 2 — discover the strings (preferred: let the SDK tell you)

Run the affected browser-control command against the localized session. When a text
matcher emits a structured `selector_drift` blocker, its `candidates` array contains the
**localized labels the SDK actually saw** — that is your source of truth, captured live:

```jsonc
{
  "ok": false,
  "status": "unsupported",
  "blocker": {
    "kind": "selector_drift",
    "code": "visible_candidate_not_found",
    "candidates": [{ "label": "<localized label to copy>" }, ...]
  }
}
```

Fallback for surfaces that don't emit candidates: open DevTools, inspect the control, and
read its `aria-label` (buttons) or visible text (menu items, mode labels). Copy the exact
characters.

### Step 3 — create the locale file and register it

Create a new file `src/dom/locale/<bcp47>.ts` (e.g. `de.ts` for German). It only needs to
include keys whose text differs from English — it `satisfies Partial<LocaleStrings>` (i.e.
`LocaleContribution`):

```ts
import type { LocaleContribution } from "./types.js";

export const de = {
  sendButton: ["Nachricht senden"],
  modeLabels: ["Neueste", "Schnell", "Denken", "Erweitert", "Pro"],
  tools: {
    web_search: ["Websuche"],
  },
  // ... only the keys that are localized in a real German session
} satisfies LocaleContribution;
```

Leave the canonical English first (it comes from `en.ts`), and leave the API keys
(`web_search`, the `effort` values) unchanged.

Then open [`src/dom/locale/index.ts`](../src/dom/locale/index.ts) and register the new
locale:

```ts
import { de } from "./de.js";
// ...
const locales: readonly (LocaleStrings | LocaleContribution)[] = [en, de] as const;
```

The combiner flattens all locales per key, English-first, deduplicating strings.

### Step 4 — rebuild, test, ship

See [Verification](#verification).

### Caveats when capturing strings

- **Punctuation is literal.** `searchChatsPlaceholder` is `"Search chats..."` with three
  ASCII dots; a localized build may use a real ellipsis `…` (U+2026). The matcher is
  case-insensitive but does **not** treat `...` and `…` as equal. Copy the exact glyphs.
- **Accents / non-ASCII are fine.** Regex special characters are escaped automatically.
- **Some controls won't localize.** If a label is still English in the localized session,
  the existing English entry already covers it — do not invent a translation.
- **One string can appear in several keys.** "Search chats" is both a button label and a
  signed-in marker; add the translation to each relevant array.
- **Project Sources labels are English-only until verified.** Do not translate the Sources
  tab, Add source button, or upload-files menu item from general language knowledge. Capture
  the actual localized Project UI first, then add only observed strings.

## Maintaining detection when ChatGPT changes its UI

Symptom: commands that used to work start returning `selector_drift` (text matchers) or a
wrong/empty read, on a locale that previously worked — usually because ChatGPT renamed a
control.

1. Reproduce against the affected session and read the `selector_drift` `candidates` (or
   inspect the control in DevTools).
2. Add the new string to the relevant array in `src/dom/locale/en.ts` (for English UI
   changes) or the appropriate `<bcp47>.ts` file (for a localized surface). Keep the old
   string — it may still be live for some users/builds.
3. Rebuild, test, ship.

Prune a string only when you are confident no current ChatGPT build still renders it;
extra candidates are cheap and harmless.

## Verification

Run from `packages/node`:

```bash
npm run build
npm test
npm run contract:validate
npm run parity:fixtures
```

To make the change live for Codex agents that load the installed skill bundle, also bundle
and sync (per `AGENTS.md`):

```bash
npm run bundle
npm run bundle:backend
npm run bundle:live-smoke
rsync -a --delete \
  --exclude node_modules \
  --exclude reports \
  --exclude .git \
  packages/node/ \
  ~/.codex/skills/codex-chatgpt-control/

# Confirm workspace and installed bundles match:
shasum -a 256 \
  dist/codex-chatgpt-control.bundle.mjs \
  ~/.codex/skills/codex-chatgpt-control/dist/codex-chatgpt-control.bundle.mjs
```

Notes:

- This is **TypeScript-internal** (DOM authority). Adding a locale needs no Python, wire,
  fixture, or protocol change, because API keys and wire shapes are unchanged.
- All consumer import paths (`from "../dom/locale-labels.js"`) are unchanged — the barrel
  `locale-labels.ts` re-exports everything from `locale/index.ts`.
- `doctor({ check: ["localization"] })` verifies that the registry is populated and
  canonical English values are present. It does not yet prove full localized selector
  coverage; treat localized workflow failures as selector-wiring work unless the registry
  is missing the observed labels.
- The public-export plugin bundles under `plugins/codex-chatgpt-control/runtime/node/` are
  produced by a separate pipeline (`tools/public-export/export-public.mjs`) and are not
  updated by the sync above.
